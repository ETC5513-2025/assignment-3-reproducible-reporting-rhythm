## Executive Summary

In this report, we will be looking at how the change from in-person learning to online learning during the period of COVID-19 has affected student's academic performance. The main findings are that the students are able to maintain their academic progress regardless of the change. However, considering the dataset it based on students in India, the groups that were mainly affected by the change were students in Class 10 and Class 12, who had public exams to prepare for in those years.

## Introduction

The transition to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered many students’ academic environments and daily routines. Widespread increases in screen exposure, reductions in physical activity, and irregular sleep patterns were observed among students. These lifestyle changes have prompted growing concern regarding their potential impact on mental health, particularly with respect to stress, anxiety, and academic performance. Understanding how such factors influence student well-being is essential, especially as digital learning continues to play a central role in education.

This report analyzes survey data collected from students between March and May 2023, with the intent of identifying relationships between lifestyle habits and mental health outcomes. The dataset consists of 1,000 observations of students enrolled in both schools and universities. It includes variables such as sleep duration, screen time, exercise frequency, stress levels, and exam-related anxiety. In this report, we seek to determine which behaviors are most closely associated with mental health challenges. The insights gained may support the development of targeted interventions to promote student wellness in remote or hybrid learning settings.

# Methodology

![](Images/Pict%20Methodology.png) This study applied multinomial logistic regression to evaluate the association between multiple independent variables and a categorical outcome with three levels: "Same", "Increase", and "Decrease". The independent variables used in the model were a combination of numerical (e.g., age, screen time) and categorical predictors (e.g., gender, education level).

![](Images/Pict%20Methodology%202.png) This method is appropriate when the response variable is nominal with more than two categories and does not follow a natural order. The "Same" category was treated as the reference level in this model.

Prior to model fitting, standard preprocessing steps were applied, including checking for missing values, standardizing numerical variables, and encoding categorical variables into dummy indicators to enable their use in the model.

The regression model estimates the log-odds of each non-reference category relative to the reference category. Separate sets of coefficients are produced for predicting "Increase" and "Decrease" outcomes compared to "Same". The model was estimated using maximum likelihood estimation.

The output of the model included regression coefficients, standard errors, and p-values for each predictor variable across both comparisons. The significance of each variable was evaluated using Wald tests, with a threshold of p \< 0.05 considered statistically significant. This approach allowed for identifying which variables had a meaningful association with changes in the response category.

This methodology provided a clear framework for determining the statistical significance of each predictor and contributed to understanding the factors associated with outcome variations in the study population.  For the variables information, please see @tbl-variable

Based on @fig-Proportion-Perfomance, most students either maintained or improved their academic performance, with only 30% reporting a decline. This reflects a mixed impact of the learning environment, where some students thrived while others struggled.

For @fig-Pie-Chart-CatVariables, the charts show that 51% of students reported feeling anxious before exams. Most participants were enrolled in master’s programs (41%). The gender distribution was balanced between male and female (both 48%), with 5% identifying as “Other.” Regarding stress levels, 49% experienced medium stress, 33% low stress, and 18% high stress.

Meanwhile @fig-Proportion-Categorical, there is no notable difference in academic performance change across groups based on exam anxiety, gender, or stress level, as the proportions of declined, improved, and unchanged performance remain relatively similar. The program appears to perform well for Master’s and Bachelor of Arts students. However, among high school and middle school students, the program is less effective.


```{r }
#| label: "fig-Numerical-Variables"
#| fig-cap: "Performance Outcome Breakdown by Categorical Variables"
#| echo: false


data_numerical <- final_data %>%
  select(Age, Screen_Time, Sleep_Duration, Physical_Activity, Academic_Performance_Change) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_", " ", .x), .cols = 1:4) %>%
  as.data.frame()


ggpairs(
  data_numerical,
  columns = 1:4,
  aes(color = Academic_Performance_Change)
)

```


Then for @fig-Numerical-Variables, there is no distinct pattern that classifies academic performance change based on the observed continuous variables. For example, students with less screen time or more physical activity are not consistently associated with improved performance. Correlation values across age, screen time, sleep duration, and physical activity remain weak, suggesting no strong relationship with performance outcomes.

z <- summary(log_fit$fit)$coefficients / summary(log_fit$fit)$standard.errors
p <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z)))



# Load reshape2 (install jika belum ada)
if (!require(reshape2)) install.packages("reshape2")
library(reshape2)

# Change to p matrix format
p_long <- melt(p, varnames = c("Outcome", "Term"), value.name = "P_value")

# Rounding p_value
p_long$P_value <- round(p_long$P_value, 4)

# Change to horizontal
p_wide <- dcast(p_long, Outcome ~ Term, value.var = "P_value")

# Show table value in horizontal
knitr::kable(
  p_wide[, c("Outcome", "`Education_Level_Class 10`")],
  caption = ""
)



```
From @tbl-pvalue, it tells about students whose performance remained the same, Class 10 students experienced a significantly higher rate of academic decline (p = 0.027). This suggests that the decline in performance was most prominent among Class 10 students.


## Conclusion

From the analysis of the data we can see that the p-values show the only significant variable to the academic performance is the level of education. From this we can infer that the groups mainly affected are students with public exams. This may be due to the fact that the students in those classes require more personal attention that online classes may not be able to provide.

Recommendations:

-   For data collection, we need more numeric variables as change in performance needs to be recorded more accurately for data analysis.

-   For the purpose of comparison, data from before COVID-19 would be highly beneficial to enable more efficient comparisons.

-   Use different models to reach solutions. More complex models, like ones that add variable interaction, may be able to find more connections between the variables.

-   Additional variables that measure quality of the interaction in the lecture, internet connection, and metrics on motivation to study would greatly increase the utility of the data.
