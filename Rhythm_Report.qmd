# Results 

The key variable in this report is academic performance. We compared the observations on the basis of the students' academic performance 

From our regression analysis we we look into the the correlation between screen time and academic performance 

In this analysis we assume that screen time is negatively correlated academic performance, meaning high screen time would result in poor academic performance 

- Figure 

Across all educational level students had the same proportion of results spread across the population. However we noticed in grade 10 and grade 12, majority students had unchanged grades. 

During grade 11 and grade 12 student sit for a board exam. Given our observation from the data set - could this mean online learning had no effect among students who sat for board exam?
